I undertook a year-long (academic year) research project alongside Abel Atnafu, Luis Bravo, Aditi Phatak, and Emily Hu as part of the UCSB Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP). This research was a partnership with the UCSB Systems and Networking Lab, headed by Professor Arpit Gupta. Our research mentor was Roman Beltiukov. 

You can view our final research poster [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V1tX5XgU97CPWW8AC1FKUjQi0PnCE7a0baB7sWcHmwM/edit?usp=drive_link), and look at some of the code [here](). I recently got a new laptop and no longer have access to the server on which much of my code is stored, so only some of the code is present in that repository. Once I go home and open that laptop, I will transfer more code over.
