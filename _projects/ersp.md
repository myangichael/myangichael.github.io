Undertook a year-long research project as a part of the UCSB Early Research Scholars Program. This research was a partnership with the UCSB Systems and Networking Lab.

Goal was to evaluate TRUSTEE, a framework that attempts to evaluate the quality of a machine learning model built on networking data. We trained several ML models on public networking datasets, then used TRUSTEE to evaluate models and search for biases.

All technical work done in Python, heavy usage of `pandas`, `pytorch`, and `sklearn`. Project ended with a poster presentation at UCSB's CS undergraduate research fair.
