I am currently working on neuroscience and computer science research related to Drosophila vision! What are Drosophila? Drosophila is the scientific term for Fruit Flies!

# Why I, as a computer science student, am doing work related to fruit flies

Fruit flies are extremely small!

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 center" style="text-align: center;">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/drosophila/drosophila_size.jpeg" title="Fruit Fly Compared to Needle" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 center" %}
    </div>

By extension, so are their brains! And yet, fruit flies exhibit qualities that we're highly interested in. One of these qualities is spatial awareness. If you close your eyes, do you know where the door is? Do you remember the path you took from the door to where you're sitting (or staning) right now? 

Even though your eyes are closed, you still know all of these things. More specifically, just by looking around as you walked into the room, you saw and subconsciously noted:

1. the location and appearance of any notable features of the room (the door, a desk, a monitor, etc.)
2. where you are in relation to all of those features (and you keep track of this as you move around)
3. how you got to where you are, and how to get to anything you're interested in

Fruit flies are capable of this too! Also, unlike humans, flies navigate along a 3D plane (we can't fly unfortunately), and if you've ever tried to swat one in midair, you know that they're exceptionally quick.

Fruit flies can do all these things that we do, and their brains are several orders of magnitude smaller! According to [Yale](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/colon_ramos/overview/#:~:text=The%20human%20brain%20consists%20of,and%20assemble%20into%20functional%20circuits.), humans have 100B neurons and 100T synapses (almost 1000x as many parameters as most Large Language Models), but these flies have only about 500K neurons and 80M synapses ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9084309/)), which is smaller than many LLMs.

In other words, fruit flies exhibit important, core behaviors related to navigation even with significantly smaller computational power. If we can figure out what parts of the  brain exhibit these behaviors, maybe we could apply them to what we're interested in (self-driving cars, drones, etc).
