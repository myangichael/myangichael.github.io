I am currently working on neuroscience and computer science research related to Drosophila vision! Drosophila is the scientific term for Fruit Flies!

# Quick TLDR

Fruit flies are small but their brains are quite smart; we want to understand how they see. Part of this is conducting real experiments with real flies. Flies see in UV, and we need to provide real subjects/images for them to look at in UV. 

My project goal is to create image-to-image models that predict UV info from RGB images; we'll show those UV images to flies and observe their brain activity.
