Hi, I'm Michael! I currently study Computer Science and Statistics at the University of California—Santa Barbara. I'm currently in Santa Barbara, but am from the CA Bay Area.

At UCSB, I am a part of [SungSoo Kim Lab](https://sungsoo-kim.mcdb.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB's Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Department, where I've been collecting data and training GANs to predict Ultraviolet Data from Visible Light images.

Outside school, I am a software engineer intern at [Principal Financial Group](https://www.principal.com/), where I also interned back in Summer 2023. There, I've designed, built, and maintained applications with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Typescript React, AWS, and Java Spring.

Besides computers and computer-related things, I like to lift, hike, and eat! Camera always eats first.
