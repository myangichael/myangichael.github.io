Hi, I'm Michael! I'm currently pursuing a double major in computer science and statistics at UCSB, and my goal is to someday attend grad school! I'm currently in the Santa Barbara area, but also frequently travel to both San Jose, CA and Bellevue, WA.

Recently, I joined the [SungSoo Kim Lab](https://sungsoo-kim.mcdb.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB's Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) Department, where I'll be training GANs and Diffusion models to mimic a fruit fly's ultraviolet vision. More on this soon!

In addition, I have internship experience both designing and implementing full stack web applications, primarily with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Typescript React), AWS, and Java Spring. I also have research experience in machine learning: last year I was a part of UCSB's Early Research Scholars Program, and had the chance to design and analyze neural networks and deep learning models for network intrusion datasets. You can read more about these in the projects section.

Aside from work, I like to lift, hike, and eat! I'm also a big fan of the Fire Emblem video game series and won't shut up about that when prompted. I'm currently working on a small page for some of my hobbies.

I'm currently still working on this website. Will add more to it soon!
